# How to setup Boom Pow! (bPoW) on Windows

## Pre-requirements
- Microsoft Windows 7 / Microsoft Windows 10 installation
- Banano-Address (https://vault.banano.cc)
- Banano-Boom PoW software (https://github.com/BananoCoin/boompow/releases)

## Install bPoW requirements
**Requirements are:**  
- python3: Interpreter for python. Version >= 3.6.7 (https://www.python.org/downloads)
- python3-pip: Package Installation program (https://pypi.org/project/pip)

**Installation:**  
- If not installed install python3 **with** pip and adding it to the system variable path  
- - If you see a Windows error: 0xc000007b. You probably have to install the Microsoft Redistribution Pack 2015. It could found here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=48145   

To check if python is working we could start it with the commandline (cmd.exe):
```cmd
python --version
```
It should resport a version number equal or greater than 3.6.7  
Then we start the same procedure for pip 
```cmd
pip --version
```
if both are working we could go to the next step.

## Edit the run_windows.bat 
This batch file is a startscript for bpow. Open it in notepad (editor).  
locate the line starting with set payout_address= and edit the Banano Address with **yours**.  
Be sure that you typed your address correct! (Starting with ban_ ..., no typos)  
Save the file and close the notepad.

## Starting the run_windows.bat
Start the batchfile by double clicking it. Two commandline windows should pop up.

## Hints
Now you will see a lot of canceled requests. Itâ€™s not a bad sign. How many of them you see depends how often your computer won the race:  
1. getting request 
2. calculating proof of work 
3. send it back.


Yet you could wait for the payout...  
(every 12 hour starting at 8:00 UTC: a 10K ban pool is shared between all clients based on their work they provide)
